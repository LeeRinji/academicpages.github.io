* I'm a fourth-year Ph.D student in the [Department of Sociology of The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.soc.cuhk.edu.hk/).
* I'm very lucky to have [LEE Jaemin](https://jaeminlee.mystrikingly.com/) and [TAM Tony Hong wing](http://www.soc.cuhk.edu.hk/profile/tam-tony-hong-wing/) be my advisors.
* My research interests lie in the general area of computational social science, social networks, big data analytics, and complex networks.

* My name written in Chinese is *李宇杰*. You may pronounce *Yujie* as *Rinji*.

* I don't use social media like Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, even though I might have accidentally registered them before.
