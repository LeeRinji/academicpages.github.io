* I'm an Assistant Professor (officially starting from March 2026) in the [Divison of Computational Social Science of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)](https://hss.cuhk.edu.cn/en/taxonomy/term/288).

* My research interests lie in the general area of computational social science, social networks, big data analytics, and complex networks.

* My name written in Chinese is *李宇杰*. Sometimes, I write my name *LI Yujie* as *Lee Rinji*.

* I don't use social media like Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, even though I might have accidentally registered them before.
